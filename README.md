this hack will allow you to hack SQOOL devices created by unowhy. you are certainly tired of having a tablet blocked by the SQOOL device...this hack unlocks it for you! 

"fresh hack by a frensh guy"

dev : @shiro.sata on instagram

tutorial : 

1. turn off your tablet. once the device is off, turn it on again by holding volume up + power button... before that, check the model of your tablet. on the back of the tablet, look at the label. if there is written "model S10G001S4M" then a menu will be displayed with written 
[recovery mode]

[fastboot]

[normal]

choose "recovery mode" by pressing volume down. if the model of your tablet is "model MT 10UWB 232" then when starting the device, and when the SQOOL logo appears: no longer press volume up + power button. the recovery mode is supposed to appear a few seconds later...

(for the rest of the tutorial, we will call the "model S10G001S4M" by the Y10 tablets and the other, the 10U tablets)

2. in recovery mode, select "wipe data/factory reset"...depending on the model, the "wipe data/factory reset" menu changes...on Y10 models there will be just

"yes

no"

but on 10U tablets, there will be written

"no
no
no
no
no
no
--yes [...]
no
no"
in any case, select "yes".

when it's done, press "reboot system now".

3. your tablet will restart. on 10U models only, you may get a message saying your tablet is corrupted and needs to be factory reset. press "factory reset" in any case... then your tablet will restart on the configuration menu... configure what you want, but do NOT configure the wifi. you must skip this step otherwise the tablet will recover as before.

4. after configuration and you are on the menu, your tablet is partially unlocked. but if you activate the wifi, all the SQOOL modules will be reinstalled and you will have done all that for nothing. let's get down to business:

go to the settings, then at the bottom on "about this device"

then click 5 times on "build number" (or something like that) and at the bottom you should see "dev mode enabled". go back to the menu and a new option appeared "developer options", in the developer options in the "debugging" section and turn on "USB debugging". go back again to my menus and go to "security" and then to "administrators"


you will see that the "SQOOLOTA" application is developer, remove it.

5. connect your devices to your pc, on the tablet there will be written if you want to be in USB debugging, press "yes". once done run "kanno-payload.exe" and inject the payload. your tablet will restart and your tablet will be unlocked!
