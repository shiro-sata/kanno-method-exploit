## Tutorial  

### Step 1: Access Recovery Mode  

1. **Turn off your tablet.**  
   Once it’s off, turn it back on by holding **Volume Up** + **Power Button**.  

2. **Identify your tablet model.**  
   Check the label on the back of your tablet:  
   - If the model is **S10G001S4M**, a menu will appear with the following options:  
     ```
     [recovery mode]  
     [fastboot]  
     [normal]  
     ```  
     Use the **Volume Down** button to select **recovery mode**.  

   - If the model is **MT 10UWB 232**, restart your device and hold the **Volume Up** + **Power Button** only until the SQOOL logo appears. Then release the buttons. **Recovery mode** should appear shortly after.

*Note*: For simplicity, we’ll refer to **S10G001S4M** tablets as **Y10** and **MT 10UWB 232** tablets as **10U** for the rest of the guide.

### Step 2: Perform a Factory Reset  

1. In recovery mode, select **"Wipe data/factory reset"**:  
   - On **Y10 tablets**, you’ll see:  
     ```
     yes  
     no  
     ```  
   - On **10U tablets**, you’ll see:  
     ```
     no  
     no  
     no  
     no  
     no  
     no  
     --yes [...]  
     no  
     no  
     ```  
   Select **"yes"** in either case.

2. Once completed, select **"Reboot system now"**.  

3. For **10U tablets only**, you may see a message saying the device is corrupted and needs a factory reset. Press **"Factory Reset"**, and the tablet will restart into the configuration menu.  

4. During configuration, **skip the Wi-Fi setup**. Do not connect to Wi-Fi, or the SQOOL system will restore itself.

### Step 3: Enable Developer Mode  

1. After configuration, your tablet will be partially unlocked.  
   - Go to **Settings > About this device**.  
   - Tap **Build Number** five times until you see a message like **"Developer mode enabled."**  

2. Return to the main settings menu, and you’ll now see a new option: **"Developer options."**  
   - Open it, go to the **Debugging** section, and enable **USB Debugging**.  

3. Then, navigate to **Security > Device Administrators** and deactivate the **SQOOLOTA** application.

---

### Step 4: Complete the Unlock  

1. Connect your tablet to your PC.  
   - On the tablet, a prompt will ask if you want to enable **USB Debugging**. Select **"Yes."**

2. Run the file **`kanno-payload.exe`** on your PC and inject the payload.  

3. Once the process is complete, your tablet will restart, and it will be fully unlocked!
